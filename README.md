# Hyperspectral-Grayscale-Image
A PyTorch U-Net GAN for spectral reconstruction. This tool converts standard 3-channel RGB images into 31-channel hyperspectral datacubes. Visualize individual spectral bands as "Hyperspectral Grayscale Images" to analyze material properties and features invisible in the original photo.
